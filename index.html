						<p>
							Basil and I are here visiting from the Pacific Climate
							Impacts Consortium *click* or (PCIC) which
							is a non-profit based out of the
							University of Victoria. Our mission is to
							bridge the gap between academic climate
							science and applied policy regarding the
							impacts of climate change.
						</p>
						<p>
							We were created in 2005, through an
							endowment from the province of BC and
							I <em>believe</em> that we were modeled
							after Ouranos. We are also structured as a
							consortium model, though we have a much
							smaller staff. I think that there are
							around 15 staff members and half a dozen
							research affilliates.

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							We work with our partners to conduct
							credible, peer reviewed research on the
							effects of climate change in BC and work
							with stakeholders such as provincial,
							regional and local governments to make use
							of that research.

							But it wasn't always as easy for us to

				<section data-background="images/conference.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						We'd have one of our team leads go to a
						conference or meeting and extoll the virtues
						of all of the great work that we had done, and
						the volumes of climate data that we have.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/handshake-reverse.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						Inevitably we'd make some connections with
						other researchers and they'd say:
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/handshake-collaborate.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						"You know, we should really collaborate."
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/handshake-data-please.png">
					<aside class="notes">
						"I'd love to take a look at some of your
						results. Can you send me your data?"
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/two-person-computer.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						So our lead research comes home from the
						conference energized and motivated and wants
						to follow up on their committments, gets one
						of our research staff as says, "Hey can you
						help me deliver our data to this other
						researcher that I met?"
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section data-background="images/hard-drive-pile.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						But it turns out that it's hard to do. We have

				<section data-background="images/three-person-computer.jpg">
					<aside class="notes">
						So they come and grab me, the Lead of

				<section data-background="images/four-person-computer.jpg">

						<p>
							"Hey Steve, can you help me get this data
							to this external collaborator?" All of a
							sudden, we have four of us a PCIC, nearly a
							3rd of our staff, coordinating, sending
							e-mails, and losing our day on releasing a
							single dataset to a single person.
						</p>
						<p>
							The situation was clearly untenable, and
							couldn't scale. What if multiple people
							wanted our data, or dozens, or hundreds?
							Were we going to dedicate our entire staff
							resources to data distribution? Obviously
							not, so we set out to fix the problem with
							a technical solution.

					<h2>Our strategy</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Small team!</li>
						<li>Leverage Open Source Software</li>
						<li>Contribute to Open Source Software</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							We have a very small dev team... there are
							only four of us who have computer science
							backgrounds. One is our system administrator
							and doesn't code, and I'm the supervisor and
							theorettically wouldn't have to code unless it
							wasn't so much fun. So realistically we only
							have about 1.5-2 FTE dedicated to our web
							services development.  Notes, notes and more
						</p>
						<p>
							With a small group, we have to make use of
							what public resources are available, so we
							heavily leverage open source software. Pretty
							much everything that we do is built on top of
							open source software.
						</p>
						<p>
							But we also make strategic investments in
							open source as well. We occasionally
							attend code sprints for the projects that
							we utilize, we have published a selection
							R packages on the R package repository,
							and we've taken over maintainence for a
							project call PyDAP that is an open source
							data server. These investments ensure that
							other members of the community don't have
							to duplicate the work that we've already
							done, and hopefully that will free up
							others to solve problems that we might
							benefit from down the road.

				<section data-background="images/downscaled_gcms.png">

						<p>
							Some of our bigger datasets are 10km,

							files are around 170 GB each.
						</p>
						<p>
							Really, most of our users are only
							interested in a spatial or temporal subset
							of that data... they want a "hyperslab",
							so it would be bad to make them download
							the whole thing, only to have them pare it
							down to a fraction of its size on their
							end.

							So we built a system that used the OpENDAP
							protocol at its core. OPeNDAP is a
							protocol built over HTTP that describes
							how to select and transfer datasets or
							subsets thereof.
						</p>
						<p>
							We took the PyDAP OPeNDAP server, hacked a
							fork of it and extended it to use
							generators, an asyncronous programming
							technique that allows us to stream the
							HTTP response, while simultaneously
							reading and processing the large NetCDF
							data files.
